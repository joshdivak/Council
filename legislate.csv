3,Decriminalize Drugs (other than marijuana),2,3,7,$,,"Decriminalisation entails the removal of criminal penalties for offences such as drug use, cultivation and possession of drugs for personal use, and possession of drug use paraphernalia. When implemented in line with harm reduction principles, decriminalisation can provide a supporting and enabling legal framework within which people who use drugs can access health interventions without fear of stigma, arrest and detention. It should be noted that decriminalisation differs from legalisation, which is a process by which all drug‑related behaviours (use, possession, cultivation, trade, etc.) become legal activities, although they may still be subject to regulation. Often, simply decriminaliizing drug use places more people in the system and can lead to increased civil penalties, like heavy fines. It is important to note that not all drug use is dependency and, as with all medical procedures inside and outside of prisons, drug dependence treatment should bevoluntary and confidential. Legalization also allows the government to regulate drugs to make them safer (i.e. heroine users will know it is not laced with fentenol).",Decriminalize use and personal possession of drugs.,https://cdn.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-point-plan-Drug-policies-WEB_final.pdf
